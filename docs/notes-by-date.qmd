One reason that the `/data/` folder is in 
the `.gitignore` file is that 
s3 will be used for storing 
data, so it doesn't make sense
to exchange data back and forth between
the github and the local computer. Cookie cutter 
data science calls this idea
"separating the codebase from the 
data" <https://drivendata.co/blog/ccds-v2#data-storage>

Here are other key resources from today: 
<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential>
and <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitfaq#_credentials>. 
The latter link has the question: how do I specify my 
credentials when pushing over https?
