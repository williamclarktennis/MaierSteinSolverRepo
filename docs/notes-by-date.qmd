One reason that the `/data/` folder is in 
the `.gitignore` file is that 
s3 will be used for storing 
data, so it doesn't make sense
to exchange data back and forth between
the github and the local computer. Cookie cutter 
data science calls this idea
"separating the codebase from the 
data" <https://drivendata.co/blog/ccds-v2#data-storage>

Here are other key resources from today: 
<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential>
and <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitfaq#_credentials>. 
The latter link has the question: how do I specify my 
credentials when pushing over https?

I am checking if Github Actions actually publishes and deploys my
website at the link: <https://williamclarktennis.github.io/MaierSteinSolverRepo/>.

Why is it not working? Please work!

I did a simple example with Python logging to gain some
motivation for loguru, present in the 
`dataset.py` file and other files. 

See `https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html` to learn about
`PROJ_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]`
in the `config.py` file.

I'm currently uncomfortable with the following files and items:

1. the `.env` file. It is currently empty. What other files
depend on it? I'm afraid I'll have to understand this file
before beginning development of source code.
2. The `Makefile`. Hopefully this file can be
ignored while I develop the source code.
3. The `pyproject.toml` file. I think this can 
be ignored while I develop source code. 
4. The `MaierSteinSolver/config.py` file. It 
says to load environment variables from the .env
file, but I don't know what those would be yet. 
5. The `dataset.py` file. When I want to develop source
code, should my code go into the main() function? I'm 
not sure how typer works, so I can't answer this question yet. 
Hopefully once I get a feeling for typer, then
I can start putting source code into the 
dataset.py file.
